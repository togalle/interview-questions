# Machine Learning Interview Questions

- Explain bias variance
  - Bias variance basically refers to the under- or overfitting of a model. When a model has high bias, it's not complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data, while a high variance means the model is too complex and doesn't generalize well to new data.
- What is gradient descent?
  - Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in the training of a ML model. It works by calculating the gradient of the loss function and nudging the parameters of the model in the opposite direction. The goal is to take steps to a minimum of the loss function.
- What is the curse of dimensionality?
  - This refers to the fact that the more dimensions data has, the further the data points will be positioned from each other. For example, if you have a 2D plane with relatively dense data points, but then introduce a third dimension, the distance between those data points will increase. This effect grows stronger with each extra dimension. It's one of the biggest challenges in ML because many algorithms use distance in their calculations.
- What is regularization?
